# CS544: Natural Language Processing
Taken by Ruijie Rao, 2023 Spring at USC.
This course brings foundation-level knowledge about NLP and Deep Learning. Sparked my interest in this area of knowledge and the further applications of generation models including chatGPT and Stable Diffusion.

## 1. Text Classification using Perceptron, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes
This assignment gives you hands-on experience with text representations and the use of text classification for sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is extensively used to study customer behaviors using
reviews and survey responses, online and social media, and healthcare materials for marketing and costumer service applications. 

Sections: Data Cleaning, Preprocessing, Feature Extraction, and Model Implementation

## 2. POS Tagging with HMM and Viterbi Decoding
This assignment gives you hands-on experience on using HMMs on part-ofspeech tagging. We will use the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn
Treebank to build an HMM model for part-of-speech tagging.

Sections: Vocabulary Creation, Model Learning, Greedy Decoding, and Viterbi Decoding

## 3. Text Classification using Deep Learning Models
This assignment is an extension to HW assignment 1, while upgrading it using Deep Learning models like FNN, RNN, GRU, and LSTM. Also provides hands on experience with training word embeddings and using pre-trained embeddings.
**Using Pytorch**

Sections: Dataset Generation,  Word Embedding, Feedforward Neural Network, and RNN variations.

## 4. Named Entity Recognition with Deep Learning Models
This assignment gives you hands-on experience on building deep learning
models on named entity recognition (NER). We will use the CoNLL-2003
corpus to build a neural network for NER. 
**Using Pytorch**

Sections:  Simple Bidirectional LSTM model, Using GloVe word embeddings, and Bonus: LSTM-CNN model
